Improving Robot State Management:
Focus on real-time updates and efficient data handling.
Use WebSockets for real-time communication between robots and the application.

Streaming Data/Logs:
Implement a logging service that streams logs to a central server or log management system.
Use a message broker like Kafka or RabbitMQ for high-throughput log streaming.

Communicating Errors:
Define a clear error reporting protocol.
Use structured logging and error handling middleware to capture and report errors.

Additional Properties:
Consider adding fields like status, severity, or source to better categorize and query states.

Other Thoughts:
Prioritize scalability and performance for handling large volumes of state data.
Implement security measures for data protection and user authentication.
